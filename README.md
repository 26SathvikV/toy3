Toy 3 for GOA's CS2: Game Dev and Design

Requirements (Given by the course):
      An isometric-view playing area, in either the 2D or 3D views, your choice
      A player that can move freely in this space
      NPCs that roam around the space using Godot’s navigation tools to control where they can go
      The NPCs can either chase the player, run from the player, or both; perhaps it’s a PacMan scenario. Your call; this decision is what will make it more like a game
      There will be boundaries that prevent the player (and NPCs) from leaving the playing area
      There will be obstacles or structures that the player and NPCs have to negotiate - they will need to block the NPCs from “seeing” the player on the other side of an obstacle; again, depending on the mechanic, this works for either the NPC’s or the player’s advantage
      You need to have a way to win and lose – leading NPCs to fall into a hole to their doom, for example, or shooting at them, or something else – again, your decision
      You can have the camera follow the player, or have it static, or something else
